# PayPerTask Skill for Pharos

> **Pay-per-task escrow primitive for AI Agents on Pharos.** Buyers escrow PHRS,
> agents submit delivery proofs, funds split on-chain between agent / platform / ecosystem.
> Includes a 7-day dispute window with admin refund.

## Why this Skill

The Pharos AI Agent ecosystem needs paid agents. This skill is the smallest
useful primitive that makes that work: **deposit → deliver → split**, all on chain.

Drop this skill into a Pharos AI Agent and any user can ask:

- *"Deploy a pay-per-task escrow on Pharos with an 80/15/5 split"*
- *"Order a token risk brief from agent 0xABC for 0.05 PHRS"*
- *"Mark order 7 delivered with proof ipfs://..."*
- *"Show me all completed orders on this contract"*
- *"Dispute order 3 — agent never delivered"*

The agent reads `SKILL.md`, finds the matching capability, opens
`references/payperask.md`, and runs the right `cast` / `forge` command.

```

## Quick start (for humans)

```bash
# 1. Install Foundry
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && source ~/.zshenv && foundryup

# 2. Configure
export PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourTestnetKey
export RPC=https://atlantic.dplabs-internal.com

# 3. Get testnet PHRS (see Pharos faucet)

# 4. Run the end-to-end demo
bash examples/basic-agent-using-skill.sh
```

You'll see the script:

1. Deploy `PayPerTaskEscrow` with default 85/10/5 split
2. Create order escrowing 0.001 PHRS against `keccak("demo prompt")`
3. Mark the order completed with `ipfs://...` as the delivery proof
4. Print the final on-chain state and `OrderCompleted` event

## Quick start (for AI agents)

```bash
# Inside the skill folder
claude  # or any AI agent that follows the Pharos Skill convention
```

Then ask, in natural language: *"Deploy PayPerTask on Pharos and run a demo
order from me to myself for 0.001 PHRS."*

The agent reads `SKILL.md`, follows the Capability Index to
`references/payperask.md`, and runs each step with the correct `cast` / `forge`
commands.

## Contract — `PayPerTaskEscrow.sol`

| Function                             | Caller    | Effect                                                              |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `createOrder(agent, inputHash)`      | Buyer     | Escrows `msg.value` PHRS for a task delivered by `agent`            |
| `completeOrder(orderId, resultHash)` | Agent/Admin | Releases escrow split between agent / platform / ecosystem        |
| `disputeOrder(orderId, reason)`      | Buyer     | Opens dispute within 7 days; blocks completion                      |
| `refundOrder(orderId)`               | Admin     | Returns full escrow to buyer (resolves dispute)                     |
| `getOrder(orderId)`                  | anyone    | Reads buyer / agent / amount / status / hashes / createdAt          |

Events: `OrderCreated`, `OrderCompleted`, `OrderDisputed`, `OrderRefunded`.

## What changed vs. AgentMartEscrow (0G version)

| Concern                | AgentMartEscrow (0G)                               | PayPerTaskEscrow (Pharos)                                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Agent address          | Single `creatorRecipient` set at deploy            | Per-order `agent` (multi-agent marketplace)                        |
| Dispute path           | None                                               | `disputeOrder` + 7-day window + admin `refundOrder`                |
| Split                  | Hard-coded 85/10/5 in `completeOrder`              | Constructor-validated bps (must sum to 10,000)                     |
| Reverts                | `require` strings                                  | Custom errors (cheaper gas, structured)                            |
| Status                 | `Created/Processing/Completed/Failed`              | `None/Created/Completed/Disputed/Refunded` (None reserves slot 0)  |
| Result hash            | `string`                                           | `string` (kept for IPFS / 0G / arweave compatibility)              |
| Input commitment       | `bytes32 inputHash`                                | Same — used to bind agent output to the original task              |

## Composability

Designed to plug into the Pharos Skill-to-Agent Cascade:

- **Storage Proof Skill** → produces the `resultHash` passed to `completeOrder`
- **Inference Skill** → executes the task whose `keccak(prompt)` was committed in `createOrder`
- **Rating Skill** → reads `OrderCompleted` events to update agent reputation
- **x402 Skill** → can use the same primitive for off-hot-path settlement

A higher-level Agent reads the Capability Index in `SKILL.md`, locates this
skill's section, and chains `createOrder → (work delegated to other skills) → completeOrder`.

## Roadmap (Phase 2 — Agent Arena)

If this skill lands a Phase 1 prize, Phase 2 is to build a complete Agent that
composes this skill with three others:

1. **Token Risk Brief Agent** — reuses AgentMart's UX, now with on-chain billing
2. **Storage Proof Skill integration** — `resultHash` becomes a real IPFS / 0G CID
3. **Rating Skill integration** — `OrderCompleted` events drive agent reputation
4. **x402 settlement** — micropayments for high-frequency agent calls
